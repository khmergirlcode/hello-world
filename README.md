# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

Gosh this feels a bit unnerving.  Trying to explore and get a footing into this new world of codes.  Will I get lost into the abyss?
Speaking of the abyss, has anyone seen or remember that movie?  There's a scene in there that has forever been etched in my memory.
Though I don't want to spoil the movie, it's definitely enlightening.
